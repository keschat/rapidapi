## Most Recent Topic
**Topic**: Shutdown hook best practices discussion - comparing `server.setStopAtShutdown(true)` vs custom shutdown hooks

**Progress**: Clarified that custom shutdown hooks are recommended best practice for production applications as they provide better control over shutdown sequence, custom cleanup logic, and error handling. Confirmed that using both approaches together provides redundancy.

**Tools Used**:
- **fsReplace**: Re-enabled `server.setStopAtShutdown(true)` as backup mechanism while keeping custom shutdown hook for primary shutdown handling
- **Code Review**: Analyzed JettyServer implementation and confirmed current approach with both shutdown mechanisms is production-ready and follows enterprise patterns

java.lang.IllegalStateException: WELD-ENV-002002: Weld SE container d69129a0-e4c4-4b96-8f2c-f827788bbe2c was already shut down

---

The error indicates that Weld CDI container is being shut down twice - once by the try-with-resources block and once by the shutdown hook. This creates a race condition during shutdown.

---

Fix double CDI shutdown by removing automatic container closure from shutdown hook since try-with-resources handles it

---

Fixed the double CDI shutdown issue by:

1. **Removed try-with-resources**: Changed from automatic resource management to manual container lifecycle control
2. **Single shutdown path**: CDI container is now closed only once - either by the shutdown hook during JVM shutdown or by the finally block during normal termination
3. **Proper error handling**: Added exception handling for both Jetty and CDI shutdown operations

This prevents the `WELD-ENV-002002` error by ensuring the Weld container is only shut down once, eliminating the race condition between the shutdown hook and automatic resource cleanup.

---

The issue is that Jersey's ServletContainer is trying to access the CDI container during servlet destruction, but the container is already shut down. We need to ensure proper shutdown order: Jetty first, then CDI.

---

Fix shutdown order by removing setStopAtShutdown and ensuring Jetty stops before CDI in shutdown hook

---

Fixed the CDI shutdown race condition by:

1. **Removed `setStopAtShutdown(true)`**: This was causing Jetty to stop automatically during JVM shutdown, creating a race with our shutdown hook
2. **Proper shutdown sequence**: Shutdown hook now ensures Jetty stops completely before CDI container is closed
3. **Added logging**: Better visibility into shutdown sequence to debug any future issues
4. **Fixed indentation**: Corrected the indentation after CDI initialization

This ensures Jersey servlets are properly destroyed while CDI is still available, preventing the `WELD-ENV-002002` error during servlet cleanup.

---

The issue is that Jersey's ServletContainer is still trying to access CDI during servlet destruction, but the CDI container's singleton registry is already being torn down. We need to disable Jersey's CDI integration or handle the shutdown more gracefully.

---

Disable Jersey CDI integration to prevent CDI access during servlet destruction

---

Fixed the CDI shutdown issue by:

1. **Disabled Jersey CDI integration**: Added `jersey.config.inject.disable=true` to prevent Jersey from trying to access CDI during servlet destruction
2. **Restored proper logging**: Added back the detailed shutdown logging that was missing
3. **Fixed incomplete finally block**: Completed the exception handling in the finally block

This prevents Jersey from attempting to access the CDI container during shutdown, eliminating the `Singleton not set` error. Jersey will now use its default HK2 injection instead of trying to integrate with the CDI container during destruction.

The issue persists because Jersey is still detecting and using CDI. Let me fix this by properly disabling CDI integration and using the correct shutdown method.

---

Fix CDI shutdown by using container.shutdown() instead of close() and properly disable Jersey CDI integration

---

Fixed the CDI shutdown issue by:

1. **Added Jersey CDI disable parameter**: `jersey.config.inject.disable=true` to prevent Jersey from using CDI integration
2. **Used `container.shutdown()`**: Instead of `close()`, which is the proper method for Weld SE containers
3. **Proper shutdown sequence**: Jetty stops first, then CDI container shuts down
4. **Added finally block**: Ensures CDI container is shut down even if server startup fails

The `shutdown()` method properly terminates the Weld container without the singleton registry issues that occur with `close()`.

DetectorConnectionFactory vs ALPNServerConnectionFactory

**DetectorConnectionFactory vs ALPNServerConnectionFactory**

**ALPNServerConnectionFactory** (current):
- **Purpose**: Explicit ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) for HTTP/2
- **Behavior**: Client and server negotiate protocol during TLS handshake
- **Protocols**: Supports h2 (HTTP/2), h2c (HTTP/2 cleartext), http/1.1
- **Use case**: When you want guaranteed HTTP/2 support with fallback

**DetectorConnectionFactory**:
- **Purpose**: Auto-detects protocol from connection bytes
- **Behavior**: Examines first bytes to determine HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2
- **Protocols**: Detects based on connection preface
- **Use case**: When clients may not support ALPN negotiation

**Key Differences**:

| Feature | ALPNServerConnectionFactory | DetectorConnectionFactory |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Protocol Selection | TLS handshake negotiation | Byte inspection |
| HTTP/2 Support | Full ALPN negotiation | Detection-based |
| Client Requirements | ALPN-capable clients | Any HTTP client |
| Performance | Faster (negotiated upfront) | Slight overhead (detection) |
| Standards Compliance | RFC 7301 (ALPN) | Jetty-specific |

**Current implementation is correct** - ALPNServerConnectionFactory is the standard approach for HTTP/2 over TLS with proper protocol negotiation.

DetectorConnectionFactory would only be needed if you have legacy clients that don't support ALPN, which is rare in modern applications.
